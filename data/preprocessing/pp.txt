[Intro: Peppa Pig]
Ting, ting
All aboard the school bus
We are going to the zoo

[Verse 1: Peppa Pig]
We're playing a tune
And we're singing a song
With a bing and bong and bing

[Chorus: Children]
Bong bing boo, bing bong bing
Bing bong, bingly bungly boo
Bing bong bing, bong bing boo
We're all going to the zoo

[Interlude: Peppa Pig]
Ting, ting
This is the zoo stop

[Chorus: Children]
Bong bing boo, bing bong bing
Bing bong, bingly bungly boo
Bing bong bing, bong bing boo
We're all going to the zoo

[Verse 2: Madame Gazelle, Peppa Pig, Children]
Children, are you ready to see all kinds of animals?
Yes, please
There's a pool, with some black and white birds waddling along
Penguins
I'm a penguin, waddle waddle
Can you waddle like a penguin?

[Chorus: Children]
Bong bing boo, bing bong bing
Bing bong, bingly bungly boo
Bing bong bing, bong bing boo
I'm a penguin at the zoo

[Verse 3: Peppa Pig & Children]
Did you hear that snapping? What could it be?
Crocodiles
I'm a crocodile, snap snap
Can snap your hands like a crocodile's mouth?

[Chorus: Children]
Bong bing boo, bing bong bing
Bing bong, bingly bungly boo
Bing bong bing, bong bing boo
I'm a crocodile at the zoo
[Verse 4: Peppa Pig & Children]
Now, we are in a beautiful warm house with flowers
And there's something fluttering around the flowers
Butterflies
I'm a butterfly, flap flap
Can flap your wings like a butterfly?

[Chorus: Children]
Bong bing boo, bing bong bing
Bing bong, bingly bungly boo
Bing bong bing, bong bing boo
I'm a butterfly at the zoo

[Bridge: Peppa Pig & Children]
There are so many animals at the zoo
Can you roar like a lion?
Roar
Can you squawk like a parrot?
Squawk squawk, squawk squawk, squawk, squawk
Or jump like a frog?
Ribbit ribbit, ribbit ribbit
And can you be a monkey?
Ooh ooh ah ah, ooh ooh ah ah

[Chorus: Children]
Bong bing boo, bing bong bing
Bing bong, bingly bungly boo
Bing bong bing, bong bing boo
We're all animals at the zoo
