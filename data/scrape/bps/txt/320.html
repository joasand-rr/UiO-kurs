                                <div class="speech-content"><p>We are here today in the Stockwell Park School in Lambeth to launch one of</p>
<p>the most important new initiatives of this administration. It is an experiment in</p>
<p>policy-making that is vital to the country&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>The Social Exclusion Unit will yield results over months and years not days,</p>
<p>but its purpose is central to the values and ambitions of the new Government.</p>
<p>Its role reflects a new mood in the country and the values of a new Government.</p>
<p>Expectations are a curious thing. Before the election many people complained</p>
<p>when I said we couldn&rsquo;t do it all at once; spending would be tough; when I</p>
<p>refused to promise more money even for worthy causes; when I emphasised</p>
<p>that the basis of a stable economy was monetary and fiscal prudence.</p>
<p>Expectations are being lowered too much, they said.</p>
<p>After the election, it is remarkable how expectations have rocketed and how</p>
<p>short the memories are of what was said before. We are accused of breaking</p>
<p>promises we never made, often by opponents who introduced the very measures</p>
<p>they now criticise us for not reversing. So let me spell it out again. We can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it all at once. It will take time. And we must never lose control of spending</p>
<p>and monetary policy. Because if we do we will repeat the pain of boom and</p>
<p>bust, of record interest rates, repossessions, soaring public debt - all the</p>
<p>attributes of a Britain which before 1st May had for the last twenty to thirty</p>
<p>years, the least stability of any major economy in the world.</p>
<p>But within this necessary prudence, do not let anyone fall for the nonsense that</p>
<p>Labour priorities are Tory ones, or that we have done just the same as them.</p>
<p>The &pound;3.5bn Welfare to Work programme. That wasn&rsquo;t a Tory policy.</p>
<p>The &pound;1.2bn School Building programme. That was never in any Tory manifesto</p>
<p>I saw.</p>
<p>The &pound;2.5bn extra spending on schools and hospitals next year. That wasn&rsquo;t in</p>
<p>any Tory spending plans.</p>
<p>The Section 11 funding cut for children from ethnic minorities in schools,</p>
<p>reversed.</p>
<p>The last government&rsquo;s cuts in Housing Benefit, reversed.</p>
<p>The &pound;50 cash help for heating for pensioners on income support and &pound;20 for the</p>
<p>rest. No Tory policy there.</p>
<p>The &pound;300m childcare strategy, with &pound;200m help to lone parents to get into jobs.</p>
<p>That never crossed Tory lips.</p>
<p>The &pound;900m release of capital receipts for housing. Not in 18 years did that</p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>VAT on fuel cut. It was the last Government that raised it.</p>
<p>But it all takes time. Welfare to work doesn&rsquo;t start until next year. It will only</p>
<p>be over time that the extra money for schools and hospitals gets through.</p>
<p>Progress I promised, and am delivering. Britain reborn in a day or even a</p>
<p>Parliamentary session - I never did promise that and couldn&rsquo;t deliver it.</p>
<p>At the heart of all our work, however, is one central theme: national renewal.</p>
<p>Britain re-built as one nation, in which each citizen is valued and has a stake; in</p>
<p>which no-one is excluded from opportunity and the chance to develop their</p>
<p>potential; in which we make it, once more, our national purpose to tackle social</p>
<p>division and inequality.</p>
<p>Hence the creation of the Social Exclusion Unit.</p>
<p>My political philosophy is simple. Individuals prosper in a strong and active</p>
<p>community of citizens. But Britain cannot be a strong community, cannot be</p>
<p>one nation, when there are so many families experiencing a third generation of</p>
<p>unemployment, when so many pensioners live on crime-ridden housing estates</p>
<p>and are afraid to go out, when thousands of truant children spend their days</p>
<p>hanging round on street corners.</p>
<p>The public knows only too well the dangers of a society that is falling apart.</p>
<p>They know that worsening inequality, hopelessness, crime and poverty</p>
<p>undermine the decency on which any good society rests. They know how</p>
<p>easily shared values and rules can unravel.</p>
<p>Social exclusion is about income but it is about more. It is about prospects and</p>
<p>networks and life-chances. It&rsquo;s a very modern problem, and one that is more</p>
<p>harmful to the individual, more damaging to self-esteem, more corrosive for</p>
<p>society as a whole, more likely to be passed down from generation to</p>
<p>generation, than material poverty.</p>
<p>Getting government to act more coherently is the key. Everyone knows that the</p>
<p>problems of social exclusion - of failure at school, joblessness, crime - are</p>
<p>woven together when you get down to the level of the individual&rsquo;s daily life, or</p>
<p>the life of a housing estate. Yet all too often governments in the past have tried</p>
<p>to slice problems up into separate packages - as if you could fix an estate by just</p>
<p>painting the houses rather than tackling the lack of jobs or the level of crime.</p>
<p>And in many areas dozens of agencies and professions are working in parallel,</p>
<p>often doing good things, but sometimes working at cross purposes with far too</p>
<p>little coordination and cooperation.</p>
<p>Joined up problems demand joined up solutions. Back in June I spoke about</p>
<p>new ways for departments and agencies to work together. I also talked about</p>
<p>the need to act to prevent problems before they get out of hand. I described</p>
<p>how government itself would have to change if it was to be the solution rather</p>
<p>than, as is sometimes the case, being part of the problem. I said that the job of</p>
<p>refashioning welfare and the job of refashioning government are inseparable.</p>
<p>The Social Exclusion Unit is a big step towards putting these ideas into</p>
<p>practice, helping government to work in a more coherent, integrated way,</p>
<p>across departmental boundaries, and with all the agencies - public, private and</p>
<p>voluntary - that can help turn things round. It will be a dynamic unit - there to</p>
<p>solve problems and to achieve results.</p>
<p>Its staff are now all appointed, and most have been at work for more than a</p>
<p>month. Its make-up - including secondees from many government departments,</p>
<p>from the voluntary sector, business, police, local government and probation -</p>
<p>exemplifies the new ways in which we need to work.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t believe that Whitehall knows best. We need practical experience.</p>
<p>We need the insights of people who have worked at the sharp end. And just as</p>
<p>we plan to bring other experience into government, so too will the unit be</p>
<p>outward looking. Finding out about the best projects, the most promising</p>
<p>initiatives. Working with communities engaged in making their own solutions.</p>
<p>And crucially, too, hearing of the socially excluded themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked the unit to make truancy and school exclusions a top priority because</p>
<p>we know that the prospects for kids who miss school are so dismal. It&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>enough if kids are missing out on the education they&rsquo;ll need to get a job and</p>
<p>make a life. What&rsquo;s worse is that for many, being out of school is the beginning</p>
<p>of a slippery slope to crime, drugs and exploitation by others. They pay a high</p>
<p>price. But in the long run we all end up paying for it as well.</p>
<p>The first message we&rsquo;re sending out today is that we&rsquo;re not prepared to sit by</p>
<p>while more and more kids are excluded or truant without taking action. There</p>
<p>will always be some who need special help that can&rsquo;t be provided in a</p>
<p>mainstream school. But good schools don&rsquo;t exclude pupils unless it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>However, we also need to acknowledge that this isn&rsquo;t a problem that schools</p>
<p>can solve on their own. They need the backing of parents and the community.</p>
<p>And they need the help of all the different agencies that work with young</p>
<p>people - social services, educational authorities and the police too.</p>
<p>The people you see here today demonstrate that commitment. They are here to</p>
<p>show their belief that it&rsquo;s no longer good enough to blame someone else - this is</p>
<p>a problem we need to solve together.</p>
<p>David Blunkett will be announcing new measures today to step up the attack on</p>
<p>exclusions and truancy by helping children who are having difficulty keeping</p>
<p>up at school, many of whom skip lessons because they can&rsquo;t keep up and won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>admit it.</p>
<p>Our actions on exclusion reflect our values and those of the British people. It</p>
<p>offends against our values to see children with no prospect of work, families</p>
<p>trapped in poverty, neighbourhoods blighted by crime.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t just about compassion. It&rsquo;s also about self-interest. If we can</p>
<p>shift resources from picking up the costs of problems to preventing them, there</p>
<p>will be a dividend for everyone.</p>
<p>We now have a chance for the first time in a generation to prevent Britain</p>
<p>irretrievably sliding into division. A chance to bring Britain together.</p>
<p>The Social Exclusion Unit is just one part of government. Every department</p>
<p>has a role to play. Every business, charity, school, and every community needs</p>
<p>to help too. But I am confident that the unit will make a particularly important</p>
<p>contribution because it is tackling directly the problems that affect the people</p>
<p>who are most excluded.</p>
<p>Help them and we change young lives for the better. Help them and we make</p>
<p>society stronger. Help them and we make Britain better. Help them and we</p>
<p>bring Britain back together.</p>
